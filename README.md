Town of Salem is a browser-based game that challenges players on their ability to convincingly lie as well as detect 
when other players are lying.The game ranges from 7 to 15 players. These players are randomly divided into alignments - Town, 
Mafia, and Neutrals. If you are a Town member (the good guys) you must track down the Mafia and other villains before they 
kill you. The catch? You don't know who is a Town member and who is a villain. If you are an evil role, such as 
a Serial Killer, you secretly murder town members in the veil of night and try to avoid getting caught.

ToS Assistant is a helpful tool to keep track of the every players roles whether or not it is a confirmed or claimed role. You can
easily drag a screenshot of the list of players in your current game to the table and it will automatically populate it with their 
name and number. There is also a textfield where you can write down and organize your thoughts outside of the game. When you know a
role is confirmed you can click on the corresponding role to highlight it and indicate that is is confirmed.
